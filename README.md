ros_object_recognition
======================

find a known object inside a pointcloud using PCL and ROS groovy
Up to this point this package computes and supports two different SHOT descriptors.
SHOT352 -> describes the shape around a keypoint
SHOT1344 -> describes the shape and the color distribution around a keypoint

The keypoints are generated by downsampling, an entropy optimized approach might follow later.
Detection was test using real pointclouds.
The package is subdivided into different ROS nodes and can be replaced easyly. 
Keypoints are published using sensor_msgs::PointCloud2 and can be directly viewed in rviz. Descriptors are published using a custom message type.
